\item This arduino codebase is used for wheel odometry, and wheel velocity control of the terpbot.
\item The controller talks to an R\+PI over serial port 0.
\item Arduino Uno is connected to 2 encoders and drives 2 motors via a dual DC motor driver shield.
\item The controller transmits current wheel velocities as ticks per unit time (75Hz) to the R\+PI.
\item The controller receives target wheel velocities as ticks per unit time (75Hz) from the R\+PI.
\item An anti-\/windup P\+ID controller is used to control the wheel velocities.
\item For the wiring logic, please look at the initialization of aptly named variables in the code.
